# Knight_Game
This is a game I made with a friend in high school for FBLA (Future Business Leaders of America) where we placed 13th place!<br>
I (Richard Holt) coded the project and made some designs while my friend (Peyton Moon) made some graphics and made all the music and sounds.<br>
This project was made using Python but if you don't have python and want to play it you can find the .exe file in the "Knight" folder.<br>
NOTE: Do not remove the .exe file from where it is or the game will not work!
